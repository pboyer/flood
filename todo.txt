POLISH

set exact number
show old-value, failure message on nodes
editing formula, number values doesn't get updated with undo/redo
logging in seems to kill your past session
login/signup sucks should work with oauth - initially
removing all connections from formula leaves hanging connection
sticky text inputs on formula, workspace tabs
curves - whats the minimum requirement - line - polyline?
transforms?
hide slider on number
ability to turn off live execution!
disable node lacing
can't tell why node failed execution - show result
node context menus are too big
don't keep workspaces that haven't been saved at least once
should remember the old 3d 
save is too sporadic
workspace execution icon in weird location
