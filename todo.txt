CURRENT

set exact number
server deployment should use dist
adding an input on a formula node when there are zero inputs results in 2 inputs
formula node input should change width based on how much user inputs, allow multiple lines
desktop zoom is too slow
login/signup sucks should work with oauth - initially
too many workspaces?  you need to hide the excess one
hide slider on number
formula node does not allow "quotes"
disable node lacing
icons for nodes
don't keep workspaces that haven't been saved at least once
should remember the old 3d orientation
workspaces menu should update when you reopen it
icons, tooltips for undo, redo, etc.

optimize css:
	eliminate inline css 
	get rid of excess bootstrap css
configure the base url for all end points - necessary for using as a service
run execution in ui thread, make calls to ui thread from worker
cancel run, turn off live execution
add a new library of nodes

FEATURE

custom nodes
archive workspaces
share workspaces, fork a workspace
describe workspace
proxy server for doing remote http
custom node
curves - whats the minimum requirement - line - polyline?
transforms?
canvas marquee selection
arbitrary javascript node - better than formula
zoom in the workspace
NURBS in flood
STL
promise-based execution

verb: 
	use a neural network to train system for local or remote exec
flood: 
	promise-based execution would allow multiple execution paths to proceed in parallel if nodes are dispatched async - this is a VERY good idea
