do not allow dragging node too far
zoom from center in workspace
why is drag so slow?
deletion is too slow
enter custom node by double clicking on the node instance
paste should be offset to workspace center
move stl export code out of workspacecontrolsview

CUSTOM NODES

don't show previews in custom node workspaces

WORKSPACES MENU

formula node input should change width based on how much user inputs, allow multiple lines
formula node does not allow "quotes"
disable node lacing
icons for nodes
should remember the old 3d orientation

FEATURE

example workspaces!
fork a workspace
share workspaces
describe workspace
arbitrary javascript node - better than formula
NURBS in flood
run execution in ui thread, make calls to ui thread from worker

THOUGHTS

verb: 
	breps
	use distributed computation
	use a neural network to train system for local or remote exec
flood: 
	promise-based execution would allow multiple execution paths to proceed in parallel if nodes are dispatched async - this is a VERY good idea
